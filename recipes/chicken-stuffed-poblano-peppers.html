    <h2>Delicious Chicken-Stuffed Poblano Peppers</h2>
    <p>Smoky/earth poblanos do have a mild kick, and act as a tender
         yet sturdy base for this cheesy chicken filling. The beans 
         and tomatoes bulk it up with more texture and flavor. The 
         sharp cheddar adds a nice tang while the pepper jack is melty 
         and spicy. The corn chips on top add a crunch and extra hit 
         of salty sweetness.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 poblano pepper, halved and seeded</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups finely chopped yellow onion</li>
        <li>5 medium cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chiles (such as RO*TEL)</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed</li>
        <li>4 ounces cream cheese, cut into cubes</li>
        <li>3 cups shredded cooked chicken</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups shredded pepper jack cheese, divided</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups shredded sharp white Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
        <li>¼ cup corn chips (such as Fritos®, crushed)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>lime wedges for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Position a rack in the center position of the oven and line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Place halved peppers, cut-side down, on the prepared baking sheet (leave stems on) and drizzle evenly with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Season inside and outside of peppers with 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until peppers are almost tender and starting to brown, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and translucent, about 6 minutes. Add garlic, cumin,
             and paprika, and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid has evaporated, about 4 minutes. Add beans and
              stir until heated through, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Remove onion mixture from heat. Add cream cheese and stir until melted, about 2 minutes. Stir in chicken, 1/2 cup each pepper jack and white Cheddar, and season with remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Spoon about 1/2 to 2/3 cup chicken mixture into each pepper half (depending on size of the pepper). Mix together corn chips and remaining 1 cup each pepper jack and white Cheddar in a small
             bowl. Top peppers evenly with cheese-chip mixture (it's okay if cheese spills onto the baking sheet).</li>
        <li>Bake until the cheese has melted and peppers are tender, about 8 minutes. Without removing peppers, turn oven to broil and broil until cheese is starting to brown in spots, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven and let cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Place 2 stuffed peppers and any cheese that has melted onto the baking sheet, onto each of 4 serving plates and garnish with cilantro.
             Serve with lime wedges.</li>
    </ol>
